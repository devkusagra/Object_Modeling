## Overview

There is a lot of research and development effort that goes into building enterprise software, which serves the customers in achieving their business goals. There are certain techniques to be followed to build the software iteratively and adapt to the changing requirements of the end users. This is where good low-level design architecture helps. 

During the course of this project,

• Understood the implementation of the Movie booking problem implementation.

• Built a Hackerrank-like contest application by applying their Core Java + design skills

• Designed & implemented the classes required for a contest framework.

• Implemented the business logic of running a simulated contest.

• Built a JukeBox application based on a problem statement from scratch.
